# Map Visualization:

In this project, I have created a map using leaflet that plots earthquakes happening globally using GeoJSON feed page provided by the USGS(United States Geological Survey). The map is updated every 5 mins, and displays all earthquake data for the past 7 Days. Further more, the map illustrates the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activites.
